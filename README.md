BoxGov DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It allows users to participate in governance by creating and voting on proposals to manage a shared Box contract, which stores a value that can be updated through successful proposals. Key features include creating proposals, viewing a list of existing proposals with their status and voting results, requesting governance tokens to participate in voting, and adding tokens to a MetaMask wallet for seamless interaction. The front-end provides an intuitive interface to interact with the DAO, displaying voting power, eligible voters, and proposal details. The project is a full-stack web3 application, with smart contracts developed using Solidity, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin Contracts, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet. The front-end is built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, using Wagmi, Viem, and Ethers.js for blockchain interactions. This project demonstrates a complete governance solution with a focus on user experience and transparency.
